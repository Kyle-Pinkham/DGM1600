I am utilizing a test to see if multipule commits will come thorugh from a single push.

Test part two, second commit.

Test part three. Nothing has changed. When I push these too the master server, it should properly display three additional commits from the total.

Adding screenshots of my recovery as seperate commits before I push and end the assignment.
