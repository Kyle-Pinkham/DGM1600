Preparing to add notes about my current experience with merging...

Currently, I've discovered that adding a new branch, or COMMITING merges to the branch, counts as a commit in and of itself in its own right.
However, while doing a merge is always treated as a commit, you do NOT have the option to comment on it until afterword.
This may be an oversight, however, Whatever branch you are working on will likely be its own... well. Branch. Of the master project in general.
I.e., submitting a PUSH REQUEST to override the MASTER FOLDER is something you would want to make a review on before removing the contents of the master.
This is proably designed so you dont accidentally do a forced-commit on changing a poorly programmed entry into the master file.

Merge commits need to first be reviewed as a push request because of their potentially distructive nature. Any merge commits from a
previously created branch into the master will likely need to be reviewed before the contents in their entirety are commited to the master folder.

While it sounds like I'm totally reiterating myself or spouting out nonsense, I tried to type this up in a way that it looks like I am
actually thinking about it *because I am* and I also put this entire paragraph into a single commit to illustrate my point.
